## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Converting csv data to data frame, WeatherAUS is cleaned by hand
```{r}
Brisbane <- read.csv(file = "southbrisbane-aq-2018.csv", header = TRUE)
BNEWeather<- read.csv(file = "weatherBNE.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```


## Find out and check the outliers
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
plot(Brisbane$PM10..ug.m.3.)
boxplot(Brisbane$PM10..ug.m.3.)
```

## Changing NA to mean
```{r}
for (i in 1 : ncol(BNEWeather)) {
  BNEWeather[is.na(BNEWeather[,i]), i] <- mean(BNEWeather[,i], na.rm = TRUE)
}

for (i in 1 : ncol(Brisbane)) {
  Brisbane[is.na(Brisbane[,i]), i] <- mean(Brisbane[,i], na.rm = TRUE)
}

summary(Brisbane)
summary(BNEWeather)
```

## omit negative
```{r}
Brisbane[Brisbane < 0] <- 0
summary(Brisbane)
```

## Write file
```{r}
write.csv(BNEWeather, file = "BNEWeather.csv")

```



## Mean group by month, need to write date label mannully
```{r}
tmp <- aggregate(Brisbane[,3:14], by = list(Brisbane$Date), FUN = mean)
summary(tmp)
write.csv(tmp, file = "BrisbaneMean.csv")
```


## Merge BrisbaneMean and BNEWeather
```{r}
BNE <-read.csv(file = "BNEWeather.csv", header = TRUE)
bm <- read.csv(file = "BrisbaneMean.csv", header = TRUE)
MERGE <- merge(BNE, bm, by = "Date")
summary(MERGE)
write.csv(MERGE, file = "Merge.csv")
```


## correlations 
```{r}
install.packages("reshape2")

merge <- read.csv("Merge.csv")

Airqu = c("Nitrogen.Oxide..ppm.","Nitrogen.Dioxide..ppm.","Nitrogen.Oxides..ppm.","Carbon.Monoxide..ppm.","PM10..ug.m.3.","PM2.5..ug.m.3.")
BneWea = c("Rainfall","MinTemp","MaxTemp","WindGustSpeed","Humidity9am","Humidity3pm","Temp9am","Temp3pm")

cor(merge[Airqu], merge[BneWea])

library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
Correlation1 = melt(cor(merge[Airqu],merge[BneWea][1:4]))
ggplot(data= Correlation1,aes(x=Var2,y=Var1,fill=value))+geom_tile()+
  xlab('Brisbane Weather')+ylab('Air quality')

Correlation1 = melt(cor(merge[Airqu],merge[BneWea][5:8]))
ggplot(data= Correlation1,aes(x=Var2,y=Var1,fill=value))+geom_tile()+
  xlab('Brisbane Weather')+ylab('Air quality')

```

## Clustering
```{r}
## import packages

package_list = c("factoextra", "cluster")
for(p in package_list){
  if(!suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(require(p, character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)))){
    install.packages(p, repos=site)
    suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(p, character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)))
  }
}

## read clean data
df <- read.csv("Merge.csv", header = T, sep = ",")

str(df)

## select numeric columns
df1 = data.frame(df["MinTemp"], df["MaxTemp"], df["Rainfall"], df["Sunshine"], df["WindSpeed3pm"], df["Humidity3pm"], df["Pressure3pm"], df["PM10..ug.m.3."], df["PM2.5..ug.m.3."])

## calculate K clusters
df1 = na.omit(df1)
set.seed(123)
gap_stat = clusGap(df1, FUN = kmeans, nstart = 25, K.max = 10, B = 500)
fviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)

## kmeans clustering, the number of k will be changed, and following the above answer 
km.res = kmeans(df1, 2, nstart = 25)
fviz_cluster(km.res, df1)

```
